# nlp-deep-learning

This repo provide Jupyter notebook for deep-learning models employed in sentiment-analysis type of NLP problem. 
The notebook is based on the dataset provided in a recent Kaggle competition 'Toxic Comment Classification Challenge' sponsered by Google.

I found the competition and dataset really unique for an accesible and beginner-friendly introduction to practical deep-learning in NLP. The single notebook introduces/deploys a number of NLP and deep-learning techniques such as word-embeddings, pre-trained word vectors, recurrent neural nets, combining RNN with CNN, and even some Keras on the way.

I also plan to add additional notebooks for some other interesting models I used in the competition such as very deep neural nets, and capsule nets.
